# multisig-wallet-automation
Automation of transaction

This is a project I started on Solidity to automate the verification of work done to transfer x amount from an employer to an employee.
I am attempting to make a program that will allow a transaction to go through after the work has passed certain criterias. 
I have made a multisig wallet to allow main percentage body to pass a transaction through.
Now I plan on making a program to have several requirements before an successful attempt at a transaction is possible.
